This simple python password generator takes two user inputs. One for the length of password and the second one for 
determining the type of password. 

There are 3 choices for the type of password. The choices are:
1. password with characters and integers 
2. password with integers and symbols 
3. password with characters, integers and special symbols

There were two features added:
Feature one consisted of just generating a password with strings.
Feature two adds integers and special symbols to password along with the 3 types of password choices.

There are three tests: 
Test 1 checks to see if user input length matches the length of password generated. 
Test 2 checks to see if the generated password is of type string for feature 1. 
Test 3 checks to see if user input of choice of password matches that of the generated password. This is done by 
checking if the generated password has the required password data type.
